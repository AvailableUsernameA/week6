## Part 2
The first trail: 71 seconds\
The second trail: 59 seconds\
I can change the content in DocSearchServer.java, but it return an error of "duplicate class" when I try to run it. Later I upload the file to remote device so it can run.\

I prefer to change the program remotely because in this case, I don't need to clone it into my computer and scp the file again. It is much easier.\
I think the amount of work I am going to do will affect my dicision. If there are too many thing to change, then I prefer to do it on local computer so I can see the syntax error labeled in the local computer.
